                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Khan518. I frequently create basic projects on ProcessingJS and HTML, as I have (nearly) mastered these programming languages. I learn coding both on Khan Academy and W3Schools. <br> <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_969962015097203646762112/">My Profile</a> <br> <a href = "https://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a></p>
            </div>
            <div id = "scratch">
                <h2>Me and Scratch</h2>
                <p>I started learning on Scratch when I was young, but in 2024 I created a new profile (NumberOneCoder763). I was also taking courses about math and grammar at that time. Afterwards, I learned HTML (on Khan Academy), which teached the basics of a webpage, but I thought that wasn't enough, so I found this website named W3Schools. It teaches about coding. After I learned HTML there, I knew a lot more. Now I am busy making projects on Scratch and still learning about HTML.</p>

            <div id = "programmingw">
            <h2>Other Programming Websites I Use</h2>
            <p>I am also learning ProcessingJs, a programming language that is kind of like JS. It's actually pretty hard to learn. Click the button below to go to Khan Academy. <br> <a href = "https://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> <br> Or, you can see a list of all programming languages here:<br><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">List of programming languages</a><br><a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/users/NumberOneCoder763/">My projects on Scratch</a></p>
            </div>
            <div id = "future">
            <h2>What I will do in the future</h2>
            <p>I will learn more about Javascript and C--, C, C+, C++, C* or C#. When I'm older, I either want to be a mathematician (yes, I'm also pretty good at math), or a programmer. Well, probably both.</p>
